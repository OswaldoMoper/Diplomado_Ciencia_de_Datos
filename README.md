## Project
This folder is to save the data analysis codes and the presentation of results of the analysis carried out with the chosen data set, which in my case is the [Formula 1 World Championship dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohanrao/formula-1-world-championship-1950-2020), which will also be found in said folder.
